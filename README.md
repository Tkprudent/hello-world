Just another repository

Hey, I am Kazeem Tijani, a graduate student at Austin Peay State University with a major in Predictive Analytics. 
I had my undergraduate degree in Industrial Mathematics, and I seek to apply my knowledge to make the world a better place.
I am here to explore all  my potentials and learn programming. I do most of my work in Python, R, SAS being a Data Scientist.
But I am open to learning new things.
